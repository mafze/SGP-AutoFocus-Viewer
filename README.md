This software extracts relevant autofocus data from the log files generated by the Sequence Generator Pro astrophoto capture software. It further allows to graph all the autofocus runs stored in the logfile and to calculate temperature coefficients and filter offsets.

Features:

- Extract Autofocus curves from SGP logfiles
- Table output of HFR values and temperatures throughout the session
- Linear regression of HFR vs. temperature data for each filter (filter offset estimation)
- Multiple logfile analysis
